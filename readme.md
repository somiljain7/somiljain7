## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm an **ML engineer and researcher** who specializes in breaking systems apart, understanding their failure modes, and rebuilding them to withstand production reality. My work sits at the intersection of **language research, speech systems, and production-grade AI infrastructure**.

I've moved past the era of impressive demos. What drives me now is **latency optimization, system robustness, and shipping AI models that actually survive user traffic at scale**. I believe the most exciting ML work happens when you're debugging edge cases at 3 AM, not when you're hitting 99% on a clean benchmark.

### What gets me excited:
- 🎯 **Production ML systems** that handle millions of requests without breaking
- 🗣️ **Voice AI** that feels natural, responsive, and culturally aware
- 🔬 **Research with real-world impact** — papers are great, but I care more about what ships
- ⚡ **Low-latency architectures** where every millisecond counts
- 🌍 **Multilingual & localized AI** that works for more than just English speakers

## 💭 Philosophy

> "The best ML models are the ones that ship. The second-best are the ones that actually work when users touch them. Everything else is just interesting math."

I believe in:
- **Pragmatism over perfectionism** — 90% accuracy in production beats 99% in a notebook
- **Latency as a feature** — fast models create better user experiences
- **Learning by shipping** — you learn more from one production failure than ten successful benchmarks
- **Open collaboration** — the best ideas come from diverse perspectives
- **Continuous improvement** — today's state-of-the-art is tomorrow's baseline

---

## 🔍 What I'm Looking For

I'm always interested in:
- 🤝 **Collaborations** on speech/NLP projects, especially for Indian languages
- 💼 **Opportunities** to work on challenging production ML problems
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Connections** with researchers and engineers pushing the boundaries of voice AI
- 📚 **Knowledge sharing** — if you're working on similar problems, let's chat!
